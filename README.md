CRUD is an acronym for Create, Read, Update and Delete.
It is a set of operations we get servers to execute (POST, GET, PUT and DELETE requests respectively).
This is what each operation does:

    Create (POST) - Make something
    Read (GET)- Get something
    Update (PUT) - Change something
    Delete (DELETE)- Remove something
